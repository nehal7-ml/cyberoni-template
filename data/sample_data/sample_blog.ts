Here's a step-by-step guide to upgrading the laptop:\n\n- Ground Yourself: To avoid static discharge, ground yourself before proceeding with any upgrades.\n\n- Remove External Battery: If your model has an external battery, slide the side tabs to remove it. For T480s models, there is only an internal battery.\n\n- Open the Laptop Case: Loosen the four outer screws of the laptop case. The two inner screws hold the keyboard in place but won't fall out. Gently pry open the case, starting from the back, to avoid damaging the plastic.\n\n- Adding an SSD: As the T480 usually comes without storage, you can install a modern M.2 NVMe 2280 SSD using a caddy and adapter. Make sure to choose the right form factor (PCIe Gen 3 x4) and secure the SSD with screws.\n\n- Memory Upgrade: The T480 offers two memory slots that are upgradable. Lift the retaining clips on each side of the existing memory module to remove it. Insert the new memory module, aligning the notches correctly, and press it down until it clicks into place.\n\n- Secondary SSD Installation: In the WAN slot, you can add a smaller 2242 form factor NVMe SSD. Slide the drive in, secure it with a screw, and attach the cable connectors.\n\n- Smart Card Reader Installation: If desired, install a smart card reader. Remove the screws securing the speaker and plastic blank, attach the cable connectors, and reassemble the laptop.\n\n- Reattach Battery and Dust Off Fan: Reattach the internal battery and ensure the fan is free from dust.\n\n- Power On and Install Software: Power on the laptop and install your desired software.
